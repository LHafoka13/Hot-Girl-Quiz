If you answer the question correctly, it will add 10 points to your current score and move you on to the next question. If you answer incorrectly, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the timer and you will be moved to the next question. There will be feedback at the bottom telling you whether the answer was correct or incorrect. 

Once you finish the last question, you will be notified that the quiz has completed. It will tell you the score you ended with, and give you a place to enter your name for storing.

<strong>Challenges</strong>

One of the challenges I ran into while building this was displaying the stored input i.e name/score. As you can see it displays as an object which doesn't look the greatest.
